From Houdini 15.5 version requires Sublime Text 3 Build â‰¥ 3103.

#### Usage and Tips
Currently, nothing special, simply install and do code. From my point, good color schemes are [1337](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/1337 Color Scheme) and SpaceCadet, which is one of the default schemes. [SublimeAStyleFormatter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/SublimeAStyleFormatter) add-on is useful to make standard Houdini libraries more readable.

### Houdini add-on for Sublime Text
Language definitions, syntax highlighting and autocompletions for VEX and HScript.


#### Installation
Drop [`VEX.sublime-package`](https://github.com/teared/vex/raw/master/VEX.sublime-package) into [Data](http://sublime-text-unofficial-documentation.readthedocs.org/en/latest/basic_concepts.html#the-data-directory)/Installed Packages

No Package Control distribution. Sorry.


#### Usage and tips
Currently, nothing special, simply install and code. From my point, good color schemes are [1337](https://github.com/MarkMichos/1337-Scheme) and SpaceCadet, which is one of the default schemes. [SublimeAStyleFormatter](https://github.com/timonwong/SublimeAStyleFormatter) add-on is useful to make standard Houdini libraries more readble.
